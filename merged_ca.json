He was an experience hiker and has been hiking in the San Gabriel Mountains since he was about 8 years old, but this time he may have hiked into the rugged mountain area just in front of a severe winter storm (dropping temperatures and severe winds with snow and rain) and possibly became trapped in the snow. His vehicle was located in the Ice House Canyon Lodge parking lot. An extensive 3 day search of the area was unsuccessful in locating Schafer.\n\nIt is believed that he had full climbing and camping equipment with him. He may have had a blue down jacket, a green sleeping bag, an orange back pack.",

Also missing is his step father, Sol Salomon, mother, Elaine Salomon, and older sister, Michelle Salomon (MP# 4560). The family was last seen on October 12, 1982, in Los Angeles, CA. The child's step father, Sol Salamon, is from Israel and lived on Lassen Street at the time.\nProsecutors had theorized that a suspect killed Sol Saloman after arguing with him over $20,000 Salomon had invested in the suspects car business in Reseda. They accused the suspect of going to the Salomon home to kill Elaine Salomon and the children, who knew the two men had been together that night at an auto show.\nAuthorities discovered small splatters of blood in one room of the Salomon family's residence. Some of the Salomons' passports, wallets and photos were discovered scattered along the Antelope Valley Freeway near Acton, California on October 17, 1982.\nThe suspect was arrested for the family's murders in August 1988. The evidence against him was circumstantial.\nThe case ended in two mistrials before the suspect was acquitted of any involvement in July 1992.\nHe is also a suspect in the 1982 disappearance and presumed deaths of Peter and Joan Davis of Granada Hills and Ron Adeeb of Burbank. Authorities believe all the cases stemmed from business disputes. He has never been charged in these cases due to a lack of evidence.",

Spellman was last seen at approximately 8:00 p.m. on April 12, 2005 at a family member's residence in the vicinity of the 13500 block of Valley Hart Drive in Sherman Oaks, California. Robert's family was expecting him to visit again on the evening of April 13, 2005. When he didn't show up and didn't call, his family stopped by his house in Woodland Hills, California the next day where things were found in a disarray which is very unusual for him.\nSpellman may be driving a blue 1998 Lexus GS400 with a rear spoiler or a green 2004 Porsche 911 convertible. He may have traveled to the Las Vegas, Nevada area after his disappearance, but this has not been confirmed.",

Eder hand carved abstract wood figures in prison.\n\nLast seen in Napa County around 1976 using the name John Wehe (phonetic) and possibly \"Dennis\".\n\nLikely connected with OMG motorcycle gang, white supramacist or anti-government organization.",

He had planned to go for a nighttime ride along the San Gabriel River. He did this often; night rides are not uncommon for an experienced horseman such as Yanez who was familiar with the area.\n\nHe vanished while on a moonlit ride along the San Gabriel River. The following day, his dog and horse returned to the stables without Rene. La Mora's saddle was askew and his blanket dripping wet. The horse's appearance prompted three days of continuous searching in the Whittier Narrows Flood Control Basin. Search dogs picked up the missing man's scent at a spot midway between the Whittier Narrows Dam and San Gabriel Boulevard, but a detailed search yielded nothing.",

She told her friend she was moving to San Jose to live with her daughter. Watkins never made it to her daughters home.\n\nHer vehicle was found two days later in the parking lot of what now is known as the Sutter Gould Medical Foundation building at 600 Coffee Road. None of her property was in the car.\n\nWatkins has 28000 dollar in cash with her when she left for San Jose. The money was from the sale of her Modesto home. She had told her banker she was going to use the money to invest in property together with a friend. Police contacted Watkins' daughter who said she knew nothing about her mothers plan to move in with her, not that she had sold her home. Several days after the car was found, the daughter received a letter from Watkins saying she was eloping to get married. Watkins' disappearance is suspicious since she gave several friends different stories as to why she was going out of town. Watkins worked as a nurse at Modesto City Hospital prior to her disappearance. Foul play is suspected, possibly a victim of James Tolliver.",

He has never been heard from again. His family reported him missing early the next morning when he did not come home.\n\nBloodhounds subsequently tracked Boone's scent from his apartment to the Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park nearby. The park is a popular place for hiking and bike riding. Authorities believe Boone may have gone hiking at the park on the day of his disappearance. An extensive week long search of the park was conducted utilizing air support, horses, bloodhounds, off road vehicles, as well as, several Search and Resue personnel yielding negative results. Investigators believe that if Boone did in fact get lost or injured while hiking, he could not have survived long in the cold winter weather.",

        "circumstance": "Houchman was last seen at home with her family, who are also reported missing. Also missing is her step father, Sol Salomon, mother, Elaine Salomon, and younger brother, Mitchel Salomon (MP# 10411). The family was last seen on October 12, 1982, in Los Angeles, CA. The child's step father, Sol Salamon, is from Israel and lived on Lassen Street at the time.\nProsecutors had theorized that a suspect killed Sol Saloman after arguing with him over $20,000 Salomon had invested in the suspects car business in Reseda. They accused the suspect of going to the Salomon home to kill Elaine Salomon and the children, who knew the two men had been together that night at an auto show.\nAuthorities discovered small splatters of blood in one room of the Salomon family's residence. Some of the Salomons' passports, wallets and photos were discovered scattered along the Antelope Valley Freeway near Acton, California on October 17, 1982.\nThe suspect was arrested for the family's murders in August 1988. The evidence against him was circumstantial.\nThe case ended in two mistrials before the suspect was acquitted of any involvement in July 1992.\nHe is also a suspect in the 1982 disappearance and presumed deaths of Peter and Joan Davis of Granada Hills and Ron Adeeb of Burbank. Authorities believe all the cases stemmed from business disputes. He has never been charged in these cases due to a lack of evidence.",

She claimed if she had any trouble with her car, she would drive it off a cliff. She appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n\nOn August 2, 1983, victims vehicle was discovered, abandoned at the Sugarloaf Trail in Shasta County. The MP had attempted to drive/climb a very steep hill and had failed. Instead of easily backing down, the driver simply abandoned the vehicle.\nWomen's clothing and purse were on the front seat. There was evidence the MP had gotten out of the vehicle, smoked three cigarettes (Benson & Hedges brand). A short distance up the hill, she sat down and smoked another. Walked another 12 feet, ate two fruit bars. At this point the tracks ended and no further evidence was located. The MP was not found and she has not been seen or heard from since.\n\nFor the next five days and extensive search of the surrounding trail area was conducted using grid searches and scent dogs with negative results, the search was suspended.\n\nThe MP was in average health and it is unlikely she could have walked the distance to get to the nearest paved road (without getting disoriented) - which was 45 minutes driving time away from where the vehicle was abandoned. Ten miles away from abandoned vehicle is \"Old Man Campground\" accessible only by dirt road.",

He left intending to go on a three-day camping trip in the Salton Sea area, traveling on the Colorado Aqueduct to the Colorado River where he had a houseboat in the Park Moabi area, approximately 10 miles southeast of Needles, California. Thompson apparently never arrived there, however.\nOn September 23, six weeks after his disappearance, Thompson's car, a light golden-brown 1986 Buick Skylark, was found disabled in the middle of the desert, four miles off Highway 177 on Phelan Pass Road, seventeen miles north of Desert Center (Riverside County). There was no sign of Thompson in the vicinity. Authorities speculate he may have camped there for the night. A campsite was found about three miles east of the vehicle. At the site authorities located a full can of beer, Thompson's knife, and an unopened pack of cigarettes. There have been multiple searches in this area. Tim has a CDL license and used to live in Georgia.",
